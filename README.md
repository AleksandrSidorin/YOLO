There is a program for YOLO object detection

I used already pre trained model

In order to run [yolo_object_detection.py.ipynb](https://github.com/AleksandrSidorin/YOLO_Computer_Vision/blob/master/yolo_object_detection.py.ipynb) we need to dowloand this files:

- coco.names
- yolov3.cfg
- yolov3.weights

In order to run [YOLO_Real.ipynb]() we need to dowloand this files:

- coco.names
- yolov3-tiny.weights
- yolov3.weights
